I am a fan of open-software and thus share many of my personal projects on GitHub. This is done in the spirit of potentially helping someone
who stumbles on a problem, or trick, that I have encountered before. In the past, I have also written a set of Java tutorials aimed at those new to programming.
This page highlights some of the projects that I have shared online.


## Software Projects  
* **[Online Communication Manager](https://github.com/mcoded/onlinecommanager)**: This is a simple Java program that I wrote in highschool to aid the administration in emailing students and their parents.
* **[Text-Based-Othello](https://github.com/mcoded/Text-Based-Othello)**: A simple game of Othello, written when I was new to Java.
* **[jarBuilder](https://github.com/mcoded/jarBuilder)**: A batch file that can build JARs. This was intended to aid me in archiving my projects.


## <a name="web"></a>Websites  
I love helping others bring themselves, their organizations, or their businesses, onto the web. The following list is of a few websites that I have helped in building and designing.  


* [Canadian Youth About Politics](http://canyap.ca)
* [DigiSol International](http://digisol.ca)
* [Home at GTA](http://homeatgta.ca)
* [Victoria Park CI](http://victoriaparkci.ca)


## <a name="android"></a>Android Applications  
While I do not currently have any Android apps on the Play Store, I am developing some ideas that I plan on introducing to the market. The source for these will be shared on GitHub.
