title: About Me
---

<p>After moving to Canada in 2001, I developed a passion for learning more about computers. I was exposed to programming in Grade 5, 
when I started participating in the First Lego League and decided that I would become a software developer. In high school, I moved on to Java, PHP and Wordpress, volunteering to redevelop the school website.</p>

<p>In university, I am learning about everthing from the workings of computer hardware to systems programming, data structures, and algorithms. I have recently taken a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and am pursuing a specialization in this area of study.</p>

<p>A PDF of my resume is available here.</p>
